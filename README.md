# find-food-freedom
A terminal-based, object-oriented Python project that leverages the use of API calls, user input, file I/O streams, and data structures to create an interactive food and recipe generator. Users are able to download recipes to a file and directory of their choosing, generate full days of eating plans to their liking, and filter API calls through a variety of metrics. Ultimately, the project aims to assist students in the nourishment of their bodies as they balance full-time education with extracurriculars.
